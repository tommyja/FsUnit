FsUnit
=======

**FsUnit** is a set of libraries that makes unit-testing with F# more enjoyable. It adds a special syntax to your favorite .NET testing framework.
FsUnit currently supports NUnit, MbUnit, xUnit, and MsTest.

The goals of FsUnit are:

* to make unit-testing feel more at home in F# , i.e., more functional.
* to leverage existing test frameworks while at the same time adapting them to the F# language in new ways.

Getting Involved
================

GitHub makes collaboration very easy. To get involved with FsUnit, simply follow the directions provided by GitHub to
fork this repository, then implement lots of cool stuff, and finally send a pull request.

A few things to keep in mind:

* Going forward, FsUnit will aim to support as much functionality as possible across all supported testing frameworks.

* Development environments need to be setup to run tests for MbUnit, xUnit.NET and NUnit. A product like ReSharper can make this easier.

* Since the unit tests for FsUnit are written with FsUnit, failing tests are just as important as passing tests.
