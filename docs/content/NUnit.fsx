FsUnit for NUnit
========================

<div class="row">
  <div class="span1"></div>
  <div class="span6">
    <div class="well well-small" id="nuget">
      The FsUnit library for NUnit can be <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/FsUnit">installed from NuGet</a>:
      <pre>PM> Install-Package FsUnit</pre>
      Sample FsUnit tests for NUnit can be <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/FsUnit.Sample">installed from NuGet</a>:

If you reference `FsUnit` from `NuGet` and want to use pretty-printed F# value types in error messages,
you have to add following piece of code to your assembly:

open FsUnit

type InitMsgUtils() =
    inherit FSharpCustomMessageFormatter()
